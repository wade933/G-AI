AI-powered stocks will face increasingly stiff competition: Analyst,"The tech sector has been on a run with chip powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) leading the charge with an incredible 86% gain year-to-date. Many of the big names in tech — Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — have been grouped together and referred to as The Magnificent Seven, but some, like Apple and Tesla, have fallen off from great heights. Now, investors are chattering over whether or not tech can weather any potential storms in the market. TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to break down the recent movements in the tech sector and how its major players can operate moving forward. O'Donnell talks about potential leaders in tech for the long-term: ""The one thing is, Nvidia's got 90% share. Anybody who's got 90% share is going to lose a little share. But, that doesn't mean they still can't grow organically from where they are. You're just going to see a lot more competitors. If we look at it collectively, I still think there is several years of growth in the collective semiconductor market for AI-powered stuff. So, you're going to see, as I said, I talked about AMD (AMD). Intel (INTC) will be interesting to see.""

Q1 2024 Takeaways: The rise and fall of the Magnificent Seven,"As the first quarter of 2024 draws to a close, Yahoo Finance's Head of News Myles Udland joins Market Domination Overtime to recap the market highlights of the past quarter. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is closing the quarter at a new record high, marking the best first quarter since 2019. While 2023 saw the Magnificent Seven tech stocks fuel market gains initially, the first quarter of 2024 is ending with only four of those names — Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) — carrying the momentum. Apple (AAPL) continues to struggle, declining for three straight months. As the gains broaden to other sectors of the market, Energy, Materials, Utilities, and Financials all benefited and were the best-performing sectors for the first quarter.

In terms of Nvidia's recent performance Neton states: ""We've seen a little bit of a slowdown in Nvidia, just in the last couple weeks...I don't think that's really all that significant, technically. We have had, even at current levels, which is at, what, 903? The stock is up 400 points which is over 80% from where it started just three months ago. It's been a rocket ship. It's been parabolic. It's given us nearly 35% of the gains in the NASDAQ (^IXIC) and about 25% of the S&P (^GSPC)... I view this as just being a temporary period of consolidation. I still think tech is going to push higher."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.
